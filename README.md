# Data_Engineering_Project_Walmart_Sales
Automated ELT pipeline for Walmart sales data with Power BI visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of Walmart sales data from a CSV file stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) into Google BigQuery. The processed data is then visualized using Power BI to provide actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory performance.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To build an automated ELT pipeline for processing Walmart sales data.
2. To create an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing sales trends and customer insights.
3. To deploy the pipeline on Google Cloud Run for scalability and automation.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Run
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: GitHub

### Key Features
- Automated ELT pipeline for processing sales data.
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing sales trends, top-performing products, and customer preferences.
- Scalable deployment on Google Cloud Run using Docker.
